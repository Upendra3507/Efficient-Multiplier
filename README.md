# Design of Efficient Multiplier with Low Power and High Speed using Pass Transistor Logic (PTL)

## ðŸ“Œ  Overview

The demand for low-power, high-speed, and area efficient digital circuits has driven the exploration of alternative logic families such as Pass Transistor Logic (PTL). The design of a multiplier circuit that leverages the inherent advantages of PTL to achieve significant improvements in power consumption, operational speed and silicon area usage. The proposed multiplier using PTL-based logic gates to generate partial products, followed by a reduction tree and a final addition stage, all optimized for performance and efficiency. Key design challenges, such as voltage degradation and level restoration inherent in PTL circuits, is addressed through carefully designed voltage restoration techniques and custom PTL cells. The architecture is compared against conventional CMOS-based multipliers to demonstrate its superiority in terms of power efficiency and speed. All the circuits are simulated using Cadence Virtuoso to analyze the power, delay, area and Power-Delay-Product (PDP) of the multiplier to highlight a substantial reduction in power consumption and a faster operation, making the PTL-based multiplier an ideal circuit for high-performance and low-power applications in modern digital systems. The proposed work contributes to the field of low-power digital design by showcasing the potential of PTL in creating multipliers which are not only efficient but also scalable for future technology nodes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows: 
**Low Power Consumption**: Conventional multipliers tend to consume significant power due to high switching activity and intricate transistor configurations. The proposed design addresses this issue by implementing pass transistor logic, which minimizes the number of transistors actively in use.
**High-Speed Computation**: Optimizing delay is crucial for achieving high-speed computations. By decreasing the number of logic levels and applying efficient switching methods, the proposed multiplier is able to deliver quicker computation times. 
**Area Efficiency**: Reducing the transistor count not only contributes to lower power consumption but also minimizes the chip area required, making it ideal for compact and embedded systems. 
**Comparison with Conventional Multipliers**: The newly designed multiplier will be compared with traditional array multipliers, Booth multipliers, and Wallace tree multipliers to evaluate enhancements in power efficiency, speed, and transistor count.
