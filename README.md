## üìå  Overview

The demand for low-power, high-speed, and area efficient digital circuits has driven the exploration of alternative logic families such as Pass Transistor Logic (PTL). The design of a multiplier circuit that leverages the inherent advantages of PTL to achieve significant improvements in power consumption, operational speed and silicon area usage. The proposed multiplier using PTL-based logic gates to generate partial products, followed by a reduction tree and a final addition stage, all optimized for performance and efficiency. Key design challenges, such as voltage degradation and level restoration inherent in PTL circuits, is addressed through carefully designed voltage restoration techniques and custom PTL cells. The architecture is compared against conventional CMOS-based multipliers to demonstrate its superiority in terms of power efficiency and speed. All the circuits are simulated using Cadence Virtuoso to analyze the power, delay, area and Power-Delay-Product (PDP) of the multiplier to highlight a substantial reduction in power consumption and a faster operation, making the PTL-based multiplier an ideal circuit for high-performance and low-power applications in modern digital systems. The proposed work contributes to the field of low-power digital design by showcasing the potential of PTL in creating multipliers which are not only efficient but also scalable for future technology nodes.

## üéØ Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows: 

**Low Power Consumption**: Conventional multipliers tend to consume significant power due to high switching activity and intricate transistor configurations. The proposed design addresses this issue by implementing pass transistor logic, which minimizes the number of transistors actively in use.

**High-Speed Computation**: Optimizing delay is crucial for achieving high-speed computations. By decreasing the number of logic levels and applying efficient switching methods, the proposed multiplier is able to deliver quicker computation times. 

**Area Efficiency**: Reducing the transistor count not only contributes to lower power consumption but also minimizes the chip area required, making it ideal for compact and embedded systems. 

**Comparison with Conventional Multipliers**: The newly designed multiplier will be compared with traditional array multipliers, Booth multipliers, and Wallace tree multipliers to evaluate enhancements in power efficiency, speed, and transistor count.

## üìä Results Summary

To perform a comprehensive comparison between our design and existing implementations, we developed an eight-bit multiplier utilizing Cadence Virtuoso with a 45nm processand a standard cell library operating at a voltage of 0.9V. The simulations were executed under standard conditions, specifically at a temperature of 27¬∞C and a supply voltage of 0.9V. This setup enables us to accurately assess performance metrics in realistic scenarios. Power consumption was evaluated using 1,000 randomly generated input patterns at a clock frequency of 500 MHz. To gauge the overall efficiency of the multiplier, we calculated the Power Delay Product (PDP), a crucial metric in digital circuit design. PDP is derived by multiplying the worst-case delay of the circuit by the average power consumption. The outcomes of our proposed multiplier design were compared with previously published studies, focusing on performance metrics such as delay, area, power consumption, and Power Delay Product. It is noteworthy that the designs used for comparison were initially implemented using a 65nm technology process. To ensure a fair and consistent evaluation, these designs were scaled down to 32nm using a specific technique referenced in the literature. Following this scaling, the corresponding power-delay data for these designs were updated to accurately reflect the effects of the new technology node. Our experimental findings indicated that the proposed multiplier exhibits significant performance enhancements compared to its closest counterparts. Specifically, our design achieved a 9.72% reduction in delay, a 13.45% decrease in area, a 15.19% reduction in power consumption, and an impressive 23.44% improvement in Power Delay Product. These results highlight the superior efficiency and performance of the proposed design. Additionally, the performance of the proposed multiplier was evaluated across a range of supply voltages, from 0.5V to 0.9V, at a clock frequency of 500 MHz.
